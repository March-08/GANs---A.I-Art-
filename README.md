# GANs A.IArt
This repository aims to track the various projects I will be developing in the study of Genrative Adversarial Networks ([GAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network)), with the goal of learning the skills to generate [AI-based art](https://aiartists.org/ai-generated-art-tools). 
I will rely mostly on the master in Deep Learning that I am following, run by [Deep Learning Italia Academy](https://elearning.academy-dli.com/) I will also use the tutorials and official guides that can be found in the documentation of [TenforFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [PyThorch](https://pytorch.org/), as well as follow the course [Complete A.I. Art Generation Course - Beginner 2 MASTER](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-ai-art-generation/).
 
Technologies based on these networks have made possible the creation of "pieces of art" that have also often been used as [NFTs](https://aimade.art/).
